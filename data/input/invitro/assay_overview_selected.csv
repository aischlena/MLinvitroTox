Electrically active cells, such as neurons, can be cultured over the electrodes, and electrical activity in these cells can be recorded extracellularly. The spontaneous firing of neurons is captured from each electrode on a microsecond timescale providing both temporally and spatially precise data. Because the recordings do not impact the health of the cells, multiple recordings can be made from the same neural network over time in culture. The CCTE_Shafer_MEA_dev assay uses primary cultures of rat cortical neurons. Recordings are made on days post-plating 5, 7, 9 and 12.

This assay endpoint, CCTE_Deisenroth_DEVTOX_RUES2-GLR_Endo_Sox17, was analyzed with bidirectional fitting relative to DMSO as the negative control and baseline activity. Using a type of inducible reporter, gain or loss-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in gene expression. Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves as a measure of endoderm differentiation.

It is designed to make measurements of inducible reporter a form of fluorescent protein induction as detected with optical fluorescence microscopy. Percentage Sox17+ cells are determined by calculating the number of Sox17+ cells divided by cell count. A cell is Sox17+ if the cell Sox17 mean intensity is 5x BMAD above the pluripotent control median cell Sox17 mean.
